### Symlinks

The vc4 driver appears to be /usr/lib/mesa/vc4_dri.so
with symlinks across to /usr/lib/dri/

for video cards in make.conf I have the following setup
VIDEO_CARDS="fbdev fbturbo vc4 modesetting"


With eselect mesa we have the following

```
# show current setting
eselect mesa show
# List available settings
eselect mesa list
# Select the software renderer via the new gallium api
eselect mesa set sw gallium
# Select the software renderer using the older classic api
eselect mesa set sw classic
```

So far this symlinks
source: /usr/lib/mesa/swrast_dri.so (classic)
source: /usr/lib/mesa/swrastg_dri.so (gallium)
destination: /usr/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so

do we need to symlink the source
/usr/lib/mesa/vc4_dri.so
to the destination
/usr/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so ?


### eselect mesa

The files for eselect mesa:

  * app-eselect/eselect-mesa
  * /usr/share/eselect/modules/mesa.eselect
  * /usr/share/mesa/eselect-mesa.conf

### Xorg ebuilds

x11-base/xorg-drivers is a meta ebuild that pulls in other ebuilds for video drivers such as
(video_cards_fbdev ? x11-drivers/xf86-video-fbdev)

xorg-drivers-9999.ebuild
video_cards_vc4

### TODO

try changing the xorg driver from fbturbo to modesetting
add modesetting to list of video drivers
emerge x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting

find symlinks with
find -L /dir/to/start -samefile /tmp/orig.file
