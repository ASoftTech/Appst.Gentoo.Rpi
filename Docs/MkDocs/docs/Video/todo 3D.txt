## TODO

### Symlinks

The vc4 driver appears to be /usr/lib/mesa/vc4_dri.so
with symlinks across to /usr/lib/dri/

for video cards in make.conf I have the following setup
VIDEO_CARDS="fbdev fbturbo vc4 modesetting"


With eselect mesa we have the following

```
# show current setting
eselect mesa show
# List available settings
eselect mesa list
# Select the software renderer via the new gallium api
eselect mesa set sw gallium
# Select the software renderer using the older classic api
eselect mesa set sw classic
```

So far this symlinks
source: /usr/lib/mesa/swrast_dri.so (classic)
source: /usr/lib/mesa/swrastg_dri.so (gallium)
destination: /usr/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so

do we need to symlink the source
/usr/lib/mesa/vc4_dri.so
to the destination
/usr/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so ?


### eselect mesa

The files for eselect mesa:

  * app-eselect/eselect-mesa
  * /usr/share/eselect/modules/mesa.eselect
  * /usr/share/mesa/eselect-mesa.conf

### Xorg ebuilds

x11-base/xorg-drivers is a meta ebuild that pulls in other ebuilds for video drivers such as
(video_cards_fbdev ? x11-drivers/xf86-video-fbdev)

xorg-drivers-9999.ebuild
video_cards_vc4

### TODO

try changing the xorg driver from fbturbo to modesetting
add modesetting to list of video drivers
emerge x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting

find symlinks with
find -L /dir/to/start -samefile /tmp/orig.file

https://github.com/gentoo/arm/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vc4

I think swrastg_dri.so and vc4_dri.so are the same file but with different names
which means in theory if we set messa to sofrware mode / gallium then it should be using vc4 for the driver
maybe we need to change the other settings such as in the config.txt to get it to work as well

the gallium driver is definitley faster than classic
look into kms driver, also I don't think we're using VC4 yet based on the below

x11-apps/xdriinfo

Get Xorg errors
grep -e '(EE)' -e '(WW)' /var/log/Xorg.0.log 

use flag dri3 enabled


I think /dev/dri/card0 is created when the xorg modules are loaded
/usr/lib/xorg/modules
the xorg config looks towards the modesetting driver
/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/modesetting_drv.so

I think the drm driver isn't being loaded at boot, tried disabling all fb drivers next

try running startx as root without xdm
try attaching a monitor then rerun
try updating xorg server to latest version

Look at flask / python for the hack space auth
check with bob, and then look at the point of sale system

It looks like the missing thing is the following in cmdline.txt

  dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d

not sure about this
coherent_pool=6M smsc95xx.turbo_mode=N
CONFIG_CMA_SIZE_MBYTES=256


cp *.dtb /boot/
cp overlays/*.dtb /boot/overlays/

CONFIG_CMA_SIZE_MBYTES=256
CONFIG_FB_BCM2708

it looks like linux-4.5-rc6-grbd works partially
but linux-4.5-rc6-grbd-r1 with the same settings doesn't boot at all

linux-4.5-rc6-grbd-r2 will be the old kernel but something we can play with

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git test1
git checkout -b rpi-4.5.y origin/rpi-4.5.y

for some reason

trying kernel sources instead of:
https://github.com/anholt/linux/tree/drm-vc4-dt
branch: drm-vc4-dt
version: 4.5.0-rc5
commit: b0c92f13203f10c341de52bb4ec94eeb7cea9ed6

git clone https://github.com/anholt/linux.git linux-4.5-rc5-anholt-vc4
git checkout -b drm-vc4-dt origin/drm-vc4-dt

trying drm-vc4-next next
also look at drm-vc4-4.5
